# Angular 13 - User Registration and Login Example & Tutorial
Build a simple user registration, login and user management (CRUD) application with Angular 10.
## Angular 13 Project Structure
The Angular CLI was used to generate the base project structure with the `ng new <project name>` command, the CLI is also used to build and serve the application. For more info about the Angular CLI see [Angular](https://angular.io/cli).

The app and code structure of the tutorial mostly follow the best practice recommendations in the official [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide), with a few of my own tweaks here and there.

Each feature has it's own folder (`account`, `home` & `users`), other `shared/common` code such as `components`, `services`, `models`, `helpers` etc are placed in folders prefixed with an underscore **_** to easily *differentiate them from features and group them together at the top of the folder structure*.

The `index.ts` files in some folders are barrel files that group the exported modules from that folder together so they can be imported using only the folder path instead of the full module path, and to enable importing multiple modules in a single import (e.g. `import { AccountService, AlertService } from '@app/_services'`).

The `account` and `users` features are organised into self contained feature modules that manage their own layout, routes and components, and are hooked into the main app inside the app routing module with lazy loading.

Path aliases `@app` and `@environments` have been configured in `tsconfig.base.json` that map to the `/src/app` and `/src/environments` directories. This allows imports to be relative to the app and environments folders by prefixing import paths with aliases instead of having to use long relative paths (e.g. `import MyComponent from '../../../MyComponent'`).

Here are the main project files that contain the application logic, I left out some files that were generated by Angular CLI `ng new` command that I didn't change.
